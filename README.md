# Convolutional_Neural_Networks

This repository is a growing collection of deep learning projects focused on **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** implemented from scratch and using popular frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch**.

The goal is to explore, implement, and compare various CNN architectures on benchmark datasets. Projects range from simple MLP-vs-CNN baselines to advanced transfer learning techniques using pretrained models.

## What You'll Find Here

- **MNIST & Fashion-MNIST** classification with custom MLPs and CNNs
- **LeNet** implemented from scratch and trained on digit classification
- **AlexNet** built from scratch and trained on multi-class image datasets
- **PreActResNet34** trained from scratch on CIFAR-10
- **ResNet34 Transfer Learning** with both feature extraction and fine-tuning
- **GoogleNet/Inception implemented from scratch and trained on Intel Image Classification Dataset

Each project is **self-contained** with its own code, visualizations, training logs, and README explaining its purpose and results.

## Goals

- Implement well-known CNN architectures **from scratch**
- Understand the **performance trade-offs** between scratch models and pretrained models
- Apply **transfer learning** techniques for efficient training
- Build a foundation for extending to **object detection, segmentation**, and other vision tasks
